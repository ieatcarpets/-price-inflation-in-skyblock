 **HOW IT HAPPENED**

To understand how it all happened, we need to first take a look at the market. there are 3 markets in skyblock: NPC, bazaar, and auction house. Both bazaar and the auction house is a player based market, which means the money circulates between players. However, NPC is not player based. Players can sell items to the npc for money, which is making the game generate money out of thin air. And with more money in the game, players are willing to afford to buy more expensive items, thus increases the price of the items in the player based market.  

 Now it all started when the Crystal Hollows update dropped. The new update introduced many things, and one of the thing is gemstones. Players can mine gemstone and sell them to the NPCs for money, and they are still very profitable even now. Because of the update, more money is being generated from the npcs than before update due to the amount of people selling gemstones to the npc. With that, there are alot more money in the game, so the price of items increased. But you ask, if there are more money in the game and the price increased, doesn't that mean that the price is still the same but just have a bigger scale factor? well, yes but no. It might be true for players that are rich and have a stable money making method. But for newer players the increase in price is not very good. The newer players does not have a good money making method, furthermore, they dont have much money tp begin with. Most money making method requires some amount of money to buy the needed items for it, so therefore new players have a hard time getting money.
